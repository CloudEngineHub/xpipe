X-Pipe (short for eXtended Pipe) is a tool that enables a fast and an efficient data transfer/exchange between
all types of producers and consumers of data, e.g. different file types,
applications, programming languages, databases, technologies, and more.

It is currently in early development and this build is an alpha version.
A lot of features are incomplete or bugged.
