### Information about antivirus programs

XPipe detected that you are running %s. As a result, you might run into a few problems due to %s detecting suspicious activity when XPipe is interacting with your shell programs. This can range from just notifications to full isolation of XPipe and your shell programs, effectively making the application unusable.

### Threat analysis

For this reason, all artifacts of every release are automatically uploaded and analyzed on [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com), so uploading the release you downloaded to VirusTotal should instantly show complete analysis results. From there you should be able to get a more accurate overview over the threat level of XPipe to you.
You can find the analysis results listed at the bottom of every release on GitHub, i.e. here:

### What you can do

If such a false-positive also happens on your end, you might have to explicitly whitelist XPipe in order for it to work correctly. Accessing shells is necessary for XPipe, there is no fallback alternative built in that does not launch shells.

If you choose to continue from here, XPipe will start calling shell programs to properly initialize, which might provoke %s.
