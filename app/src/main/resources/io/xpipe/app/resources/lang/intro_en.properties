introTitle=Data sources
introDescription=Pipe, manage, and store many different types of data.
introCollection=Data source collections allow you to store and\norganize all your data sources for later use.
introPipe=Pipe data from any origin to any destination\nacross formats while maintaining compatibility.
introDocumentation=In case you prefer a more structured approach to\nfamiliarizing yourself with X-Pipe, check out the documentation:
introEntry=Once you have done that, you can add a new data source to it.\nThere are different types of data sources to choose from:
introTableDataSource=Tabular data sources, for example a database table, an excel sheet, or a csv file.

dataSourceIntroCollection=Collection data sources contain multiple sub data sources. \nExamples are zip files or file system directories.
storeIntroTitle=Adding Connections
storeIntroDescription=Connect to remote systems, databases, and more.

storeDatabaseDescription=Database connections allow you to connect to\na database server and interact with its contained data.
