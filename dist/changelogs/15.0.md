## Tailscale support

You can now connect to devices in your tailnet via your locally installed tailscale commandline client. This integration supports multiple accounts as well to switch between different tailnets.

## PuTTY import

You can now import saved PuTTY sessions on a system when searching for available connections. This also works for KiTTY.

## Fixes

- Fix password prompts for tunneled VM SSH connections showing wrong hostname as localhost
