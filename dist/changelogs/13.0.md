## Shell session caching

A central change in XPipe 13 are the improvements of reusability of shell sessions running in the background. Whenever you access a system or a parent system, XPipe will connect to it just as before but keep this session open in the background for some time, under the assumption that users will typically perform multiple actions afterward. This will improve the speed of many actions and also results in less authentication prompts when you are using something like 2FA.

A common example would be stopping and starting a container. Previously this would have resulted in two connections to the container host system and would have taken a while. Now, there will only be one connection to the host and all actions you perform on that host will be significantly quicker.

## KVM

There is now support for KVM virtual machines that can be accessed via `virsh`. This includes support for remote URLs as well.

## Fixes
