Implement experimental terminal docking. The idea is to dock your existing terminal emulator into the XPipe window so it feels like and behaves like an integrated terminal. This feature is only available on Windows for now and only works correctly with a terminal that supports tabs (e.g. Windows Terminal). This feature is not finished and is more meant as an experiment to see whether people would like to see such a thing. You can share your feedback on it. Depending on the feedback, I can evaluate whether this is the right direction to go forward.
