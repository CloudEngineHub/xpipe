## Translations

A big new feature of XPipe 9 are translations. These were initially generated with DeepL and can be easily improved and corrected by anyone on GitHub. You can check them out in action and if there is any translation you don't like, submit a quick pull request to fix it. For instructions on how to do this, see https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/lang.

## SSH connection improvements

- The custom SSH connections now properly apply all configuration options of your user configuration file

They also now support defining multiple host entries in place, which is useful for cases where you want to use ProxyJump hosts in place without having to define them elsewhere.

## SSH X11 Forwarding

You can now enable X11 forwarding for an SSH connection.

XPipe allows you to use the WSL2 X11 capabilities for your SSH connection. The only thing you need for this is a [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) distribution installed on your local system. XPipe it will automatically choose a compatible installed distribution if possible, but you can also use another one in the settings menu.

This means that you don't need to install a separate X11 server on Windows. However, if you are using one anyway, XPipe will detect that and use the currently running X11 server.

## Keyboard control

It is a goal to be able to use XPipe only with a keyboard. This can be done either for productivity reasons or for accessibility reasons. XPipe 9 introduces improved keyboard support with new shortcuts and improved focus control for navigating with the arrow keys, tab, space, and enter.

## An improved logo

The application logo has been improved with of regards to contrast and visibility, which often was a problem on dark backgrounds. it should now stand out on any background color.

## Terminal improvements

The terminal integrations have been reworked across the board. To better show which terminals are well supported and which aren't, there is now a status indicator for every available terminal. This will show you how good the XPipe integration with each one is and which terminals are recommended to be used with XPipe. 

- The kitty terminal is now fully supported with tabs on both Linux and macOS
