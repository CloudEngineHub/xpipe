# XPipe Pro Preview

The feature you are trying to use is available in the pro preview, which allows anyone who is interested to try it out newly released professional-only features for two weeks after their release. It also allows you to experiment, share feedback, and get a glimpse of all the new features without having to purchase anything.

As a side effect, the new features also receive a better test coverage then would otherwise be possible without the preview for everyone.

## Verification

Once the preview plan is activated, the application will communicate with the license server on every startup to verify that everything is in order. From there, it also fetches the current information of which features are currently new and are still included in the preview.

You can also disable the preview again at any time.
