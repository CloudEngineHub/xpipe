# XPipe Pro Preview

The feature you are trying to use is available in the professional edition preview, which allows anyone who is interested to try it out newly released professional edition features for two weeks after their initial release. It allows you to experiment, share feedback, and get a glimpse of all the new features without having to purchase anything.

## Verification

Once the preview plan is activated, the application will communicate with the license server on every startup to verify that everything is in order. From there, it also fetches the current information of which features are currently new and are still included in the preview.

You can also disable the preview again at any time.
