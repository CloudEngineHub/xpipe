## Tunnel Origin

XPipe is fully flexible with regards on where to execute a command.
Therefore, you can establish a tunnel starting on any remote system in addition to your local machine.

The tunnel opener command will be executed on the system you specify here, so you need to have an `ssh` client installed on that system.
If the origin is not the local machine, XPipe will keep a connection open to that remote system in the background to manage the tunnel.
