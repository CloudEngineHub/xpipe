## Tunnel Origin

XPipe is fully flexible with regards on where to execute a command.
Therefore, you can establish a tunnel on any system in addition to your local machine.

The tunnel opener command will be executed on the system you specify here, so you need to have an `ssh` client installed on that system.
If the origin is not the local machine, XPipe will keep a connection open to that remote system in the background to manage the tunnel.
